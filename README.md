# NYC-Airbnb-Dashboard-R
## Welcome to NYC Airbnb Price Analysis
This Dataset was taken from the following source: https://www.kaggle.com/dgomonov/new-york-city-airbnb-open-data

## Context
Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more unique, personalized way of experiencing the world. 
This dataset describes the listing activity and metrics in NYC, NY for 2019.

## Purpose of this Dataset:
I have chosen this dataset because I am curious about the algorithm of Airbnb and finding the necessary correlation between the prices of the rentals
and the different causes and factors that might play in increasing or decreasing its value.
I am planning with this data to find these main factors and the ability to later build a predictive model that can determine the right price of 
the Airbnb rentals in NYC.

I have noticed from some correlation analysis that I have ran, the reviewing system on Airbnb does not have to do with the price 
and the attractiveness of the rentals. Geographical locations play the most crucial role in the pricing level.
